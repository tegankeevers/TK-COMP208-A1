											<h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											What is learning? There isn’t just one straight forward answer to this question, but rather many differing opinions from educational theorist and sciences about the ideas that underpin student learning. 
											I believe that learning is a multidimensional process that students participate in continuously throughout different aspects of their lives. 
											How students view themselves and the world around them affects the way in which they respond to physically, psychologically, and social environments around them. 
										</p>
										<p>
											As outlined by Alexander and Schallert, the foundation for the learning processes focuses on the systemic, dynamic, and interactive relation between the learner and the object or subject that they are learning. 
											Student learning looks at the change in behaviour because of experience or teachings. Then how do we know our students are actually learning? 
											Learning theories explain how students gain, process, retain, and recall information and knowledge throughout the process of learning. 
										</p>
										<p>
											My teaching philosophy encapsulates my beliefs, views, and educational theories that are all implemented into the classroom practice and the learning environment I create. 
											I am a woman working in a teaching discipline that is predominantly lead by older male teachers, I am striving to change that narrative, proving that gender does not decide which technology subject you have to teacher. 
											I aim to encourage gender equality throughout the key learning area of TAS, ensuring that all students have equal opportunity to complete the subjects they wish. 
											Thus, creating a safe, supportive, and inclusive classroom environment that encourages students’ participation and engagement in classroom activities and assessment tasks. 
											I want to encourage students to be lifelong learners as educational and school settings are designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to become active citizens within the society which they live in.
										</p>
										<p>
											Promote critical and creative thinking through subject specific activities and tasks that focus on students developing higher order thinking skills. 
											Incorporating the theoretical framework from Bloom’s taxonomy to understand and measure students learning depth at specific points within the learning cycle allows me 
											to interpret the depth of students learning from the most basic knowledge to the deeper and more complex components and learning outcomes. 
											The skills, knowledge and understanding that students need to acquire throughout Industrial Technology Timber require a variety of different teaching strategies. 
											By building strong positive relationships with all my students while ensuring I understand their learning needs allows me to cater for all the different learning styles of my students. 
											This is underpinned by educational theorist Howard Gardner, and his research on the importance of understanding Multiple Intelligences. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Developing assessment capable learners are students that can assess and understand their own leaning while being self-reflective. 
											Clarifying learning intentions and success criteria makes goals meaningful and challenging demonstrates why learning is important. 
											Teaching students that seeking feedback builds successful learners who can adjust their actions to continue to improve. 
											Giving students guided and autonomous choices over the planning, development, construction, and evaluation of practical projects and processes allows them to successful and engaged learners. 
											As a teacher I will continue to keep learning and growing as I am the lead learner in my classroom. It is important for me to keep expanding my skills through experimenting being curious and trying new things and opportunities. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Within my practice I will ensure that I demonstrate and promote eSafety strategies by providing students with the skills and tools knowledge around the safe use of school websites, accessing school based internet domains and the how to interact appropriately with peers online. 
											This will ensure students feel supported and safe using classroom and school technology. 
											An important aspect of developing my practice will be learning together with my colleagues and others to gain new insight into the industrial technology key learning area. 
											Through staying informed about new evidenced based strategies, research, and new and emerging technologies I will ensure that I am connecting content and activities to the ever changing world.
